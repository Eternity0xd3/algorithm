# Algorithm

A repository containing some logical problems (like chess game) and the searching algorithm to solve them.

> I have no idea whether they can be associated with 'AI'. Maybe it can?

contains:

- minimax
- tree
- graph

Maybe I can try to optimize my former code and make it into a Python package.
